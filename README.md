I'm continuing my work on ML text-to-speech and speech-to-speech models, building upon my previous project, Gothic-Symetria. In this new endeavor, I'm focused on creating Polish dubbing for the game Risen I, which originally lacked Polish voiceovers, only having subtitles added a few years ago. To achieve this, 
I've utilized the Elevenlabs API for character dubbing, coupled with the capabilities of SVC models, to elevate the authenticity of the voices in the game Risen I.

short description of my files:

bash/concat: A Bash script for creating appropraite file basing on my initial data to enable instant cloning via Elevenlabs.

Utilizing SVC speech-to-speech models and a process queue for executing inference commands:

A similar approach to "char_research," but initially experimenting with Google Cloud Platform TTS before selecting the more reliable Elevenlabs solution:

Analyzing line structures and utilizing data structures to extract data for Elevenlabs API:

Analyzing and boosting volume.

Original file structure tinkering with pandas:
